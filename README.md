# Automatic License Plate Detection using CNNs with TensorFlow and InceptionNet

This project implements an automatic license plate detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and the InceptionNet architecture. The goal is to accurately identify and extract license plates from images for applications in areas like traffic monitoring, security, and vehicle management.

## Features

- **InceptionNet Architecture**: Utilizes the powerful InceptionNet model, known for its deep layers and efficient computation, to accurately detect license plates in various conditions.
- **TensorFlow Implementation**: Built with TensorFlow, a leading machine learning framework, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes image preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model robustness.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Provides scripts for training the model on a custom dataset and evaluating its performance.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Capable of processing images in real-time, making it suitable for live video feeds.


## Applications

- Traffic monitoring and management
- Automated toll collection
- Security and surveillance
- Parking management systems
